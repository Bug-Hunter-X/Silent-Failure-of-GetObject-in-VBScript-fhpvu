This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked error in VBScript: the silent failure of the `GetObject` function.  The `GetObject` function is frequently used to interact with COM objects like Excel or Word. However, if the object is not running or the ProgID is incorrect, `GetObject` might return `Nothing` without raising any error, making debugging difficult.  The `bug.vbs` file shows how this can lead to runtime issues. The solution, in `bugSolution.vbs`, showcases a more robust approach that explicitly checks for errors after calling `GetObject`, preventing unexpected behavior.
